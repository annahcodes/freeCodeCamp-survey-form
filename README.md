# freeCodeCamp Survey Form Project

This is the first project in the new
[Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) curriculum by freeCodeCamp.

For this project we were required to build a survey form that collects data from users.

Building the project helped me put into practice everything I have covered so far including concepts like

- HTML
- Forms
- Form Validation
- Basic CSS
